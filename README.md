Peaches & Green is a vegetarian recipe website with the aim of inspiring a bit more creativity when it comes
to vegetarian cooking in the home. This website will appeal to all home cooks and particularly those that
are curious and unsure about where to begin when it comes to vegetarian cooking. Simple, easy, everday
vegetarian cooking for vegetarians and the vegetarian curious.

## Demo

## UX

### Strategy

This website is for all homecooks that are looking to add simple, easy, affordable plant based meals to their diet.
The website aims to use ingredients that most people have in their homes, ingredients that are affordable and
ingredients that are not too daunting when delving into the vegetarian meal world. This is going to be achieved by
having limited ingredients, beautiful images, takes on traditionally meat based classics and most of all delicious
simple recipes to follow. Visitors will want to come back time and time again to find out what else
they can create in the kitchen and what new recipes are on offer.

### Scope

For users, the site owner wanted to achieve a website that is welcoming and unambigious. From the moment 
the user visits the website it is clear that this is a vegetarian website with lots of 
delicious recipes to choose from. The user will also have the option to contact the site owner should 
they wish to do so and this can be done using the contact form or through one of the social media platforms. 

### Structure

In order to meet the expectation of the "Peaches & Green" users the wesbite aims to stick to convention in
it's layout and architecture. 

There is a Header section on each page, with a "Peaches & Green" logo. Clicking on this logo will 
take the user back to the landing page of the wesbite and this is, as mentioned above, an expected and understood convention. 
There is a navbar within this header element, the navbar appears in a horizontal fashion, encouraging the user to 
explore and easily showcasing what is available and what this website is about. This makes all elements of the website
easily discoverable and aims to ensure the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. 

The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent.Returning visitors will know what to expect
and feel a sense of comfort when browsing the website. 

The website is interactive and provides elements of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of the hover functionality 
for links and they changing of button colors when a form is submitted. The form will require users to input the correct information 
and they will be notified if the information is incorrect. 

The architecture of the website has been considered to allow for ease of movement through the content. The structure will allow 
the user to navigate easily and will encourage the user to browse through and learn more about the website. 

Information in this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institure](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/f6e2d80e148e43ce8ea42f85e00b7adc/?child=first)

### Skeleton

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below :

* [Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Mobile%20Wireframe.pdf)

* [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Tablet%20Wireframe%20.pdf)

* [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Desktop%20Wireframe%20.pdf)

### Surface

#### Design

The overall design of the website is minimalist and simple. I want the user to simply navigate from page to page and not 
feel overwhelmed by being inundated with information. Simplicity and the use of images are used to 
achieve this design. 

#### Colour

A neutral palette of Pale Peaches, Greys, White and Black will be used for this website. The use of such colours is 
to allow the food photography to be the main point of colour, also the pale peach marries well with the theme 
of "Peaches & Green". 

When choosing the colour I used the [Colour picker tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool)

#### Typography

Source Sans Pro was chosen and paired with Lato as per the popular pairings section within [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?query=source+san&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Lato|Source+Sans+Pro:wght@300#pairings) 

* font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
* font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

The above fonts are minimalist and simple again in keeping with the overall theme of the wesbite. 

#### Images

All images used throughgout the website have been carefully chosen to ensure there is a running theme from page to page. The images have also been 
selected to be inviting to the user featuring simple and familiar dishes. The food images are not what you would see in a michelin 
star restaruant but what you could easily expect to see in a domestic setting. The aim was to make the user feel that they can re-create the images at home. 

#### Final project variations

* In keeping with the overall simplicity of the website, changes were made to the Header section on larger screens, the header and navbar section 
were simplified, initially it was the site owners aim to have a large logo and header, but this when implemented was not in keeping with the overall 
simplistic feel of the website. 

* The footer was amdended and the links to internal webpages removed, this was done to allow for a more clean look on the webpage. The footer without 
the links looks much more aesthetically pleasing and further navigation links are not required given the limited size of the website. 

* In order to ensure that user stories were met, the name of the Pantry section in the navigation bar was changed to Essentials. 
The site owner felt this navigation link name is more desirable and user focused answering the common quesiton "what do I need to get started". 

* On the essentials page an image of peaches was used, and the peaches are aligned on this image to the left, therefore  the text was aligned to the 
right, this is contrary to what was planned in the wireframes. The reason for this change is this is more asthetically pleasing and 
also makes the page more readable. On larger screen no background filter is required and on a smaller screen a shadow is applied to make this more readable. 

## Features

### Existing Features

* Header - the Header features on each page of the website, this allows the user to easily navigate through the website. Clicking on the Peaches & Green logo acts as 
a home button, having the other navigation links also allows the user to browse the website . As mentioned above this is a convention that users now know to expect. 

* Footer - the Footer also exists on every page and again this a convention that user have become accustomed too and therefore it was important that this was 
adhered to on this website.The footer contains the social media icons, this is an important feature as it allows the user to access and further explore the 
world of "Peaches & Green" and this is reflected in the user stories. The footer also contains a copyright feature to protect the content and the creator. 

* Carousel - this showcases the website's 3 most recent recipes and the recipes will be seasonal and fit with the time of year.

* About Me - provides a snippet of informaiton about me and why "Peaches & Green" came to life.

* Subscribe - allows users to subscribe to a weekly newsletter with additional recipes and also unlocks recipes on the website. This has the added impact of 
allowing further interactivty with users and increasing the level of returning customers. 

* Recipe Cards - as per the user stories, simple navigation, and users quickly being able to find what they are looking for are very important factors. The use of the 
card deck provides a beautiful visual representation of the recipes and this allows users to seamlessly find what they are looking for and if they are unsure what 
they are looking this should provide inspiration. 

* Individual Recipe Pages - simple, easy and achieveable is the aim of these pages. The photo on this page is carried through from the recipe card page or carousel, 
this is intentional and offers a sense of fluidity to the user. The recipe page has a visual guide that is then broken down into 4 sections serving size, preparation time, 
cooking time and simplicity level. At a glance this offers the user much of the information that they will need. On this page there is also an ingredients list and method 
all again displayed in a simple fuss free manner. 

* Essentials - this list was created to take away the "I have no idea where to start" mindset when it comes to vegetarian cooking. This is a statement that is very familiar to many 
vegetarians and this page is a great starting point for the non-vegetarain when embarking on their first vegetarian recipes. 

* Contact Page - this enables users to reach out to me to ask questions, provide feedback and potentially make requests for meal ideas. This also allows the site owner 
to gather information on the users dietary preference should the users provide this information. This information has the knock on impact of allow the site owner to 
target their audience more effectively. 


### Features left to implement

* Cookies Banner pop up - this should be added to ensure complaince with legislation relating to personal data and how 
that data is managed.

* Recipe review - this would allow users to provide feedback on the recipes, how they found the recipe and potentially showcase their own photographs. 

* Contact form drop down menu - text within this drop down should be centered in keeping with the overall theme of the form. 

* Javascript - given the site is constructed with HTML and CSS only. Javascript would improve the interactivity of the website 
 to make the website more engaging for visitors. 

## Technologies Used

* [HTML5](https://www.graycelltech.com/why-use-html-5/) was used as this is the latest Hypertext Markup Language and this is the standard language for describing the contents and appearance of Web Pages.
  All major browsers offer HTML5 support. 

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used as this lends itself to quickly design and customize mobile first-sites.

* [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to style the website fonts and ensure they complimented each other.

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as this is an open source platform for automated and ready to code development environments that blends into your existing workflow.

 - I-Phone 11 (1792 x 828 - Safari 14.2)
 - Honor 10 (2280 x 1080 - Google Chrome)


### Features Tested 

* All external links open in a seperate tab when clicked.

* All navigation links in both the Header and Footer are working, I did note that the Facebook icon was linking to Pinterest and this 
was amended to link to the correct website. 

* When testing it was noted there was no alt attribute attached to the photograph in the About Me section, the alt attribute was 
added and the appropriate information given.

* When testing the Header Section on the following devcices Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2XL, I-phone 5/SE/6/7/8/8 Plus, I-phone X, 
I-pad, I-pad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold & Desktop. I noted that the burger bar moved underneath the title Peaches & Green on the 
Iphone5 / SE and on the Galaxy Fold. With this a media query  was specifically created and the issue resolved. 

* On the carousel it was observed that when displaying the image of Tomato Soup the entire page appeared to move. This was assessed and 
determined that the sizing of the image was different to the other images on the carousel. The image size was amended and the problem resolved. 

* The subscribe button aligned to the left on smaller screens, this was not in keeping with the submit button located just above 
and was therefore amended to sit in the centre on smaller screens.

* The subscribe button and submit button had taken on the incorrect colours when testing, this was assessed and corrected. 
There was additional code added further down the style CSS sheet that should have been deleted. 

* When testing the Essentials page, a text shadow was required to allow the text to be read on smaller devices. This was tested on Moto G4,
 Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2XL, I-phone 5/SE/6/7/8/8 Plus,I-phone X, I-pad, I-pad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold & Desktop.

* When testing my contact page by entering dummy information. I noted that I had incorrectly put email in for the input type for 
the enter your first and last name section. This was changed to text. I also noted that I had incorrectly placed the required format 
for the text box in the wrong place. Both were amended and re-tested and appear to be working satisfactorily.

* The text within the dietary preference option on the contact me form was not centered and therefore not streamlined with the 
other input fields, this was amdended using a text-indent command, please see features left to implement on how to further 
improve this feature.

* When viewed on Safari on an I-phone 11, the photographs on the individual recipe pages appeared stretched. This was assessed and 
a coding error was identified the 'div class = col' was missing. This was amdended and the issue was rectified. 


### Third Party Services 

* When tested on a slower internet connection there was a delay in the images loading, thus having a negative imapct on the 
overall user expereince. Images were far too high a resolution. Two technologies were used to remedy this. [Pixler](https://pixlr.com/)
was used to re-size the images to an optimum for websites (798 x 1280) and [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) was used to compress the 
re-sized images further reducing the file size. 

* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) was used on an on-going basis to test the website on numerous devices. 

* Testing was carried out on CSS using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and 6 errors were identified all 
errors related to the use of the backdrop filter and the error stated that this property does not exist. The use of the backdrop-filter 
was removed and instead a text shadow was used. The CSS file was tested again with the changes and no issues were found.

* Testing was carried out on all HTML files using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and an error
was identified on each page, there was a semi-colon missing from the copyright symbol within the footer secttion, the semicolon was added and the issue rectified.
An additional error was identified on the index.html page in that there was no alt attribute attached to the photograph in the About Me section, the alt attribute was added 
and the appropriate information given. Re-testing was carried out and no further issues identified. 
 
* [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to parse the CSS and add vendor prefixes. 

* [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) was used for cross browser testing, an example of the testing carried out is highlighted below in the screenshot. 
Testing was carried out on Internet Explorer 11, Firefox 82.0 & Google Chrome 87.0.4280.88. and Safari 14.2.
