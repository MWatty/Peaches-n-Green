Peaches & Green is a vegetarian recipe website with the aim of inspiring a bit more creativity when it comes
to vegetarian cooking in the home. This website will appeal to all home cooks and particularly those that

## UX

### Strategy

This website is for all homecooks that are looking to add simple, easy, affordable plant based meals to their diet.
The website aims to use ingredients that most people have in their homes, ingredients that are affordable and
ingredients that arent too daunting when delving into the vegetarain meal world. This is going to be achieved by
having limited ingredients, beautiful images, takes on traditionally meat based classics and most of all delicious
simple recipes to follow. Visitors will want to come back time and time again to find out what else
they can create in the Kitchen and what new recipes are on offer.

### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide a wesbite that is welcoming and unambigious. From the moment 
the user visits the website it is clear that this is a vegetarain website with lots of 
delicious recipes to choose from. The user will also have the option to contact me should 
they wish to do so and this can be done using a form or one of the social media platfornms. 

Site Constraints: given the site is constructed with HTML and CSS only I would say that in the interactivity of the 
website could be improved with the use of Javascript to make the website more engaging for visitors. 

### Structure

In order to meet the expectation of "Peaches & Green" users the wesbite aims to stick to convention in
its layout and architecture. 

There is a Header section  on each page, with a large "Peaches & Green" logo. Clicking on this logo will 
take the user back to the landing page of the wesbite and this is as above an expected and understood convention. 
There is a navbar within this header element, the navbar appears in a horizontal fashion, encouraging the user to 
explore and easily showcasing what is available and what this website is about. This makes all elements of the website
easily discoverable and aims to ensure the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. The Header section also 
contains social media icons a very important element of all food related website, this encourages social media following and 
inturn icreses traffic to the website. (Took some time to place the social media icons where I wanted then had to research positioning 
within the jumbotron)

The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consitent and should aim to act as a fingerprint for 
the website. The site owner aims to use the colours, themes and temminology as a fingerprint, returning vsitors know 
what to expect and feel a sense of comfort when browsing the website. 

The website is interactive and provided elements of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of the hover functionality 
for links and they changind of button colors when a form is submitted. The form will require users to input the correct information 
and they will be notified if the information is incorrect. 

The architecture of the website has been considered to allow for ease of movemnent through the content. The structure will allow 
the user to navigate easily and will encourage the user to browse through and learn more about the website.

### Surface

#### Design


#### Colour

A neutral palette of Pale Peaches, Greys, White and Black will be used for this website. The use of such colours is 
to allow the food photography to be the main point of colour, also the pale peach marries well with the theme 
of "Peaches & Green". 

When choosing the colour I used the [Colour picker tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool)

## Features

### Existing Features

### Features left to implement

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* Bootstrap 4.5.2
* Gitpod
* GitHub 

## Testing

* Cannot get the prettier function to work updated it but still not working. Checked on Slack appears there is an issue with it (06/12/2020). 

* When checking the footer to ensure that it was responsive on all devices, I noted that the dots between the website links 
did not look streamlined on mobile devices. Need to potentially create a media query for this to 
ensure that it has a streamlined appearance. Also potentially will remove the social media links in the header on mobile devices to ensure 
it doesnt look too busy.
