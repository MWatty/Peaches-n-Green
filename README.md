# PEACHES & GREEN

Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend - Code Institute

Peaches & Green is a vegetarian recipe website with the aim of inspiring a bit more creativity when it comes
to vegetarian cooking in the home. This website will appeal to all home cooks and particularly those that
are curious and unsure about where to begin when it comes to vegetarian cooking. Simple, easy, everday
vegetarian cooking for vegetarians and the vegetarian curious.

## Demo

A live demo can be found here [here] (to be completed)

## UX

### Strategy

This website is for all homecooks that are looking to add simple, easy, affordable plant based meals to their diet.
The website aims to use ingredients that most people have in their homes, ingredients that are affordable and
ingredients that arent too daunting when delving into the vegetarain meal world. This is going to be achieved by
having limited ingredients, beautiful images, takes on traditionally meat based classics and most of all delicious
simple recipes to follow. Visitors will want to come back time and time again to find out what else
they can create in the Kitchen and what new recipes are on offer.

### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide a wesbite that is welcoming and unambigious. From the moment 
the user visits the website it is clear that this is a vegetarian website with lots of 
delicious recipes to choose from. The user will also have the option to contact me should 
they wish to do so and this can be done using a form or one of the social media platfornms. 

Site Constraints: given the site is constructed with HTML and CSS only I would say that in the interactivity of the 
website could be improved with the use of Javascript to make the website more engaging for visitors. 

### Structure

In order to meet the expectation of "Peaches & Green" users the wesbite aims to stick to convention in
its layout and architecture. 

There is a Header section  on each page, with a large "Peaches & Green" logo. Clicking on this logo will 
take the user back to the landing page of the wesbite and this is, as above an expected and understood convention. 
There is a navbar within this header element, the navbar appears in a horizontal fashion, encouraging the user to 
explore and easily showcasing what is available and what this website is about. This makes all elements of the website
easily discoverable and aims to ensure the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. 

The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consitent and should aim to act as a fingerprint for 
the website,returning visitors also know what to expect and feel a sense of comfort when browsing the website. 

The website is interactive and provides elements of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of the hover functionality 
for links and they changing of button colors when a form is submitted. The form will require users to input the correct information 
and they will be notified if the information is incorrect. 

The architecture of the website has been considered to allow for ease of movemnent through the content. The structure will allow 
the user to navigate easily and will encourage the user to browse through and learn more about the website. 

Information in this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institure](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/f6e2d80e148e43ce8ea42f85e00b7adc/?child=first)

### Skeleton

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below :

* [Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Mobile%20Wireframe.pdf)

* [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Tablet%20Wireframe%20.pdf)

* [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/Peaches-and-Green/blob/master/wireframes/Desktop%20Wireframe%20.pdf)

### Surface

#### Design

The overall design of the website is minimalist and simple. I want the user to simply navigate from page to page and not 
feel overwhelmed by being inundated with information. Simplicity and the use of images in place of text are used to 
achieve this design. 

#### Colour

A neutral palette of Pale Peaches, Greys, White and Black will be used for this website. The use of such colours is 
to allow the food photography to be the main point of colour, also the pale peach marries well with the theme 
of "Peaches & Green". 

When choosing the colour I used the [Colour picker tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool)

#FCE4D8;
#F8E9E2;
#FFCBA4

#### Typography

Source Sans Pro paired was chosen and with Lato as per the popular pairings section within [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?query=source+san&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Lato|Source+Sans+Pro:wght@300#pairings) 
* font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
* font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;


#### Images

All images used throuhgout the website have been carefully chosen to ensure there is a running theme from page to page, the images ahve also been 
seleted to be inviting to the user, with familiar dishes and a sense of achievebaility, the food images are not what you would see in a michelin 
star restaruant but what you could easily expect to see in a home setting. My aim was to make the user feel that they can re-create the images. 

#### Final project variations

* The footer was amdended and the links to internal webpages removed, this was done to allow for a more clean look on the webpage. The footer without 
the links looks much more aesthetically pleasing and further navigation links are not required given the limited size of the website. 

* On the essentials page I used a an image of peaches, and the peaches are aligned on this image to the left, therefore I aligned the text to the 
right, this is contrary to what I had initially planned in my wireframes. The reason for this change is  this is more asthetically pleasing and 
also makes and page more readable. On larger screen no background filter is required and on a smaller screen a blur is applied to make this more readable. 

## Features

### Existing Features

* Header - the Header features on each page of the website, this allows the user to easily navigate through the website. Clicking on the Peaches & Green logo acts as 
a home button, having the other navigation links also allows the user to browse the website . As mentioned above this is a convention that users now know to expect. 

* Footer - the Footer also exists on every page and again this a convention that user have become accustomed too and therefore it was important that this was 
adhered to on this website. The footer houses a link for each page again allowing for streamlined browsing. The footer also contains the social media icons, this is an 
important feature as it allows the user to access and further explore the world of "Peaches & Green" and this is reflected in the user stories. The footer also 
contains a copyright feature to protect the content and the creator. 

* Carousel - this showcases the websites 3 most recent recipes and the recipes will be seasonl and fit with the time of year 

* About Me - provides a snippet of informaiton about me and why "Peaches & Green" came to life 

* Subscribe - allows users to subscribe to a weekly newsletter with additional recipes and also unlocks recipes on the website. This has the add on impact of 
allowing further interactivty with users and increasing the level of returning customers. 

* Recipe Cards - as per the user stories, simple navigation and users quickly being able to find what they are looking for are ver important factors. The use of the 
card deck provides a beautiful visual representaiton of the recipes, and the addition of informaiton in the footer should allow users to seamlessly find what 
they are looking for and if they are unsure what they are looking for exactly this should provide inspiration. 

* Individual Recipe Pages - simple, easy and achieveable is the aim of these pages. 

* Essentials - this was created to take away the "I have no idea where to start" when it comes to vegetarian cooking. This is a statement that is very familiar to me and
I believe this page answers this question. 

* Contact Page - this enables users to reach out to me to ask questions, provide feedback and potentially make requests for meal ideas 



### Features left to implement

* Cookies Banner pop up, this should be added to ensure complaince with legislation relating to personal data and how 
that data is managed  

* Recipe review, this would allow users to provide feedback on the recipes, how they found the recipe and potentially showcase their own photographs 

* Contact form drop down menu text within this drop down should be centered in keeping with the overall theme of the form 


## Technologies Used

* [HTML5](https://www.graycelltech.com/why-use-html-5/) was used as this is the latest Hypertext Markup Language and this is the standard language for describing the contents and appearance of Web Pages
  All major browsers offer HTML5 support which makes it the newest technology used today. 

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes 

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used as this lends itself to quickly design and customize mobile first-sites

* [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to style the website fonts and ensure they complimented each other 

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as this is an open source platform for automated and ready to code development environments that blends into your existing workflow

* [GitHub](https://github.com) was used as a hosting platform for version control

## Testing

* When testing the Header Section and its responsiveness, I noted that I was taking a desktop first approach in terms of design and 
therefore re-assessed the work and amended it to reflect my wireframes and ensure that I was consistent in a mobile first approach

* When testing the Header Section on the following devcices Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2XL, I-phone 5/SE/6/7/8/8 Plus, I-phone X, 
I-pad, I-pad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold & Desktop. I noted that the burger bar moved underneath the title Peaches & Green on the 
Iphone5 / SEand on the Galaxy Fold.With this a media query specifically designed for the I-phone 5 was created and the problem resolved

* When testing the pantry page, I observed with the style of photograph used and with the peaches aligining to the left and 
the text aliging to the right this was easily readable on larger screen given the neutral background, however on smaller devices
a backdrop filter was required to blur so that users could continue to read the content. This was tested on 
Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2XL, I-phone 5/SE/6/7/8/8 Plus, I-phone X, I-pad, I-pad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold & Desktop

* When testing my contact page by entering dummy information. I noted that I had incorrectly put email in for the input type for 
the enter your first and last name section. This was changed to text. I also noted that I had incorrectly placed the required format 
for the text box in the wrong place. Both were amended and re-tested and appear to be working satisfactorily

* In order to ensure that my user stories were met, I amended the name of the Pantry section in the navigation bar to Essentials. 
As a user I feel this navigaiton link is more desirable and user focused. This will allow for someone that may be embarking on 
making and creating their first vegetarian dishes to think what do I neeed to get started in the Kitchen

* The background filter used to blur was not applied to the "10 essentials for your Kitchen Pantry" this was amended 
and checked on all devices 

* All external links open in a seperate tab when clicked

* All navigation links in both the Header and Footer are working, I did note and amnded that facebook social media icon as this was 
incorrectly going to pinterest

* The text within the dietary preference option on the contact me form was not centered and therefore not streamlined with the 
other input fields, this was amdended using a text-indent command, please see features left to implement on how to further 
improve this feature 

* The subscribe button aligns to the left on smaller screens, this was not in keeping with the submit button located just above 
and was therefore amended to sit in the centre on smaller screens
